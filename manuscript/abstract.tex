Key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Phenotypic measurements of antigenic advance outperform genetic estimates from epitope mutations in long-term forecasts}
\item{DMS measurements enable more precise identification of mutationally intolerant sites to replace previous sites based on all non-epitope regions}
\item{Phylogenetic fitness metrics outperform and appear to be mutually exclusive of mechanistic metrics}
\item{Distance-based model target performs as well or better than clade-based targets and enables future forecasting efforts where phylogenies are not feasible}
\item{We provide (the first?) open source, extensible forecasting framework for influenza}
\end{itemize}
