  \caption{
  Time-series cross-validation scheme for simulated populations.
  Models were trained in six-year sliding windows (gray lines) and validated on out-of-sample data from validation timepoints (filled circles).
  Validation results from 30 years of data were used to iteratively tune model hyperparameters.
  After fixing hyperparameters, model coefficients were fixed at the mean values across all training windows.
  Fixed coefficients were applied to 9 years of new out-of-sample test data (open circles) to estimate true forecast errors.

  Sample dates were annotated as the generation in the simulation divided by 200 and added to 2000, to acquire realistic date ranges that were compatible with our modeling machinery.

  A) Coefficients and B) distances are shown per validation timepoint and test timepoint as in Fig.~\ref{fig:unadjusted_model_accuracy_and_coefficients_for_simulated_populations_controls}.
  The epitope antigenic novelty model relies on previously published epitope sites \cite{Luksza:2014hj}.
  The ``oracle'' antigenic novelty model relies on sites of beneficial mutations that were manually identified from the entire training and validation time period (Methods).
  The improved performance of the ``oracle'' model indicates that the sequence-based antigenic novelty metric can be effective when sites of beneficial mutations are known prior to forecasting.
