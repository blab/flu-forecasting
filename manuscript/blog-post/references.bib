	abstract = {Seasonal influenza viruses repeatedly infect humans in part because they rapidly change their antigenic properties and evade host immune responses, necessitating frequent updates of the vaccine composition. Accurate predictions of strains circulating in the future could therefore improve the vaccine match. Here, we studied the predictability of frequency dynamics and fixation of amino acid substitutions. Current frequency was the strongest predictor of eventual fixation, as expected in neutral evolution. Other properties, such as occurrence in previously characterized epitopes or high Local Branching Index (LBI) had little predictive power. Parallel evolution was found to be moderately predictive of fixation. While the LBI had little power to predict frequency dynamics, it was still successful at picking strains representative of future populations. The latter is due to a tendency of the LBI to be high for consensus-like sequences that are closer to the future than the average sequence. Simulations of models of adapting populations, in contrast, show clear signals of predictability. This indicates that the evolution of influenza HA and NA, while driven by strong selection pressure to change, is poorly described by common models of directional selection such as travelling fitness waves.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: The analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of a population with many polymorphic loci is challenging, as a large number of possible genotypes needs to be tracked. In the absence of analytical solutions, forward computer simulations are an important tool in multi-locus population genetics. The run time of standard algorithms to simulate sexual populations increases as 8L with the number of loci L, or with the square of the population size N.Results: We have developed algorithms to simulate large populations with arbitrary genetic maps, including multiple crossovers, with a run time that scales as 3L. If the number of crossovers is restricted to at most one, the run time is reduced to L2L. The algorithm is based on an analogue of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and allows for arbitrary fitness functions (i.e. any epistasis). In addition, we include a streamlined individual-based framework. The library is implemented as a collection of C++ classes and a Python interface.Availability:http://code.google.com/p/ffpopsim/.Contact:richard.neher@tuebingen.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
